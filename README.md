# Developer Portfolio

[**Live Demo**](https://devin-edwards.netlify.app/)

My portfolio website to showcase my project work and writing. Built using html, scss, javascript and bundled with parcel. Feel free to repurpose it for your own work!

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Change content in index.html. Some important checks:
    1. Do the buttons link to the content you expect?
    2. Are your images correct?
    3. Optional: Change color schemes in index.scss
3. Deploy site. I recommend [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for this process!
